  target_description: "Low-income Black, Native American, and Hispanic families with teenagers who developed type 2 diabetes. Households earning under $40,000 annually, often single-parent families living in food deserts with limited access to fresh, healthy foods. These communities face disproportionately high rates of teen diabetes and have been specifically targeted by ultra-processed food marketing. Many rely on SNAP benefits and shop at convenience stores or discount retailers in their neighborhoods. Parents work multiple jobs or shifts, leading to reliance on quick, processed meals. Limited transportation to grocery stores with fresh produce. Families have been purchasing heavily marketed processed foods that were affordable, convenient, and aggressively promoted in their communities, contributing to their teen's diabetes diagnosis.",
